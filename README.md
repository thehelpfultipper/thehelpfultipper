# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Welcome to The Helpful Tipper!

We're so glad you decided to join us on our coding adventures ðŸ™Œ

THT is . . .

- the product of a brother-sister duo
- a blog about learning how to code
- self-made and self-taught ðŸ’«

Here you'll find a collection of projects, tutorials, and tips about coding that we've created as part of our mission to share knowledge and help others along the way.

From basic HTML and CSS to more advanced concepts like JavaScript and React, we cover a wide range of topics.

So, feel free to explore our projects, try out our tutorials, and learn from our tips. Our goal is to create a welcoming and inclusive community where we can all learn from each other.

And if you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out. We're always happy to hear from our readers and help in any way we can.
